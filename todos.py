"""A place for general TODOs."""

# *** Patterns and Threats; Pattern Matching ***
# TODO: List all threats, win patterns including relevant permutations and edge cases.
# TODO: Implement Pattern Class. And sub-class Threat?
# TODO: Looking into what other pattern_search functions we need.
# TODO: We need at least the threats/(new threats?) generated by a given move.
# TODO: Identify duplicate threats along the same direction (same cost/threat square)!
# TODO: Duplicate point is relevant for Freestyle for sure. What about Standard?

# *** Profiling and Testing ***
# TODO: Create tests and profiling fns for pattern_search.

# *** State Represenation ***
# TODO: Finish up state initialization procedures.
# TODO: Rich state data structures?

# *** Performance Concerns ***
# TODO: Do we need to always get the side of the board? Can't we just assume it to be size?
# TODO: Inline numba jitted functions?
# TODO: Remove unnecessary asserts.

# *** Linting and Conventions ***
# TODO: Cleanup import statements.

# *** Standard Gomoku Implementation ***
# TODO: We can rely on the win patterns to differentiate Standard and Freestyle.
# TODO: We need to make sure that the threats are also specialized appropriately for either case.
# TODO: Control Freestyle or Standard via a global flag? Or better to do via State?
# TODO: Implement Standard Gomoku.

# *** Swap2 Implementation ***
# TODO: Implement Swap2 (and update relevant checks and code).
