# *** Profiling and Testing ***
# TODO: Create tests and profiling fns for pattern_search.

# *** State Represenation ***
# TODO: Finish up state initialization procedures.
# TODO: Rich state data structures?

# *** Performance Concerns ***
# TODO: Do we need to always get the side of the board? Can't we just assume it to be size?
# TODO: Inline numba jitted functions?
# TODO: Remove unnecessary asserts.

# *** Linting and Conventions ***
# TODO: Cleanup import statements.

# *** Standard Gomoku Implementation ***
# TODO: Can we just rely on the win patterns to differentiate Standard from Freestyle?

# TODO: Implement Standard Gomoku.

# *** Swap2 Implementation ***
# TODO: Implement Swap2 (and update relevant checks and code).
